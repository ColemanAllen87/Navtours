What was your motivation? I wanted to learn how to use SASS in a practical manner for future website development. 
Why did you build this project? I built this website to help myself learn SASS and how to organize CSS, I love the state of Nevada so wanted to show case some of the beautiful places most people dont think about when they think of Nevada.
What problem does it solve? This website solves orgnaization problems with CSS, CSS can easily become messy with a lot of code, using SASS it allows me to keep the website clean on the coding side with seperate files and folders for each coding type. This would make it easy to read for anyone who has experience with SASS. 
What did you learn? I learned how to use the power of SASS with things such as variables, being able to call on things I use a lot, instead of entering the same code over and over I can create a variable and then call on it saving a lot of room and keeping my code clean.
What makes your project stand out? I think the clean animations and simplistic design that gets to the point stands out. I try to make the website simple for the average person to use easily.
